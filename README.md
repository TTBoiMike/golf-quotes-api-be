# Golf is a game of Quotes

This is the a custom built REST API built using express and then deployed using Heroku. The insipiration for this project came from my love for golf. I researched 50 of my favourite quotes about golf and built an API for developers to use these quotes. You can view the front end of this project [in this repo](https://github.com/TTBoiMike/golf-quotes-api). The API can return all quotes, quotes at random, and filter quotes by tag and name.
